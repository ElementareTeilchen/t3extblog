## Idea & goals

This extension is a (almost) fully featured, record based blog extension for TYPO3 CMS. 
It's based upon Extbase and Fluid.

This extension works as an improved replacement for the legacy extension `EXT:t3blog`.
Easy data migration as a slightly modified SQL and TCA is used.

This extension could (but should probably not) be used for starting a new blog with TYPO3.
Keep in mind: TYPO3 is not a dedicated blogging platform.
