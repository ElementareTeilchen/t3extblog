TYPO3 t3extblog
===============

A flexible blog extension for TYPO3 CMS powered by Extbase / Fluid which aims to replace t3blog.


Current state
-------------
Stable - in production use but missing some features from the original extension.


Idea & goals
------------
This extension aims to be an improved replacement for `EXT:t3blog`. It's based upon Extbase and Fluid.
Easy data migration as a slightly modified SQL and TCA is used.

This extension could (but should probably not) be used for starting a new blog with TYPO3.
Keep in mind: TYPO3 is not a dedicated blogging platform.
