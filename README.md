TYPO3 t3extblog
===============

This is a TYPO3 Extbase / Fluid extension which aims to replace t3blog.


CURRENT STATE
------------
Not for production use!

All basic features implemented. Basic FE without styling. 
Notification mails and SPAM control for comments.
Uses t3blog TCA and SQL.



IDEA & GOALS
------------
I'm tired of non maintained extensions and hardly to maintain code and unclean logic.
Tried to built a clean Extbase / Fluid alternative around the old codebase.
Migration not needed as old SQL and TCA is used.

This extension should not be used for starting a new blog with TYPO3.

More to come...
