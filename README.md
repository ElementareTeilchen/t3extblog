TYPO3 t3extblog
===============

This is a TYPO3 Extbase / Fluid extension which aims to replace t3blog.


Current state
------------
Not for production use - very alpha! Broken commits ahead!

All basic features implemented. Basic FE without styling. 
Notification mails and SPAM control for comments.
Uses t3blog TCA and SQL.



Idea & goals
------------
I'm tired of hardly maintained extensions and hard to maintain code with unclean logic.
Tried to built a clean Extbase / Fluid alternative around the old codebase.
Migration not needed as old SQL and TCA is used.

This extension should not be used for starting a new blog with TYPO3.

More to come...


Todo
------------

* ViewHelper for more marker
* BE Module for posts
* BE Module for comments
* Cleanup extension from extension builder files
* Trackback / Pingback
* Blogroll?
* Hooks for list module when changing comments?
