You can write Blogposts using the classic way: Open the folder or page you set for storagePid using the list module,
add a new record. If not done already, add at least a title and one category.

But t3extblog comes with a simple backend module. You will find it in the "WEB"-section. It looks like this:

Just keep the blog post hidden and use the "Save document and view page" button
(at the top, next to the "Save and close record" button) within your post records.
