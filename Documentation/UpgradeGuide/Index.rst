Upgrade from 1.0.x to 1.1.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**FlashMessage ViewHelper**

FlashMessage VH now works like the Fluid default one (ul or div mode, no more h5 and p tags).
Note that the error partial has changed accordingly.

Make sure styling still matches your needs as the HTML is slightly different now.
